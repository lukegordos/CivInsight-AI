### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS for geospatial data
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis for caching and Celery message broker
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for media files
- **ML Platform**: Hugging Face Inference API
- **Deployment**: Docker containers with Docker Compose

## 🤖 Machine Learning Pipeline

### Hugging Face Models Integration
1. **Text Classification**: Zero-shot classification for issue categorization
2. **Image Analysis**: Object detection, image captioning
3. **Visual Q&A**: Targeted analysis for specific civic issues
4. **Sentiment Analysis**: Priority scoring from text sentiment

### Supported Issue Types
- Infrastructure: potholes, broken streetlights, damaged signs
- Environmental: flooding, debris, pollution
- Safety: traffic hazards, vandalism, emergencies
- Public services: trash overflow, maintenance needs

### ML Workflow
```
Report Submission → Preprocessing → ML Analysis → Classification → Prioritization → Notification
```
